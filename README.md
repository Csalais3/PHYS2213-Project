# PHYS2213-Project (Live Voice Decomposition)
This program has 3 different sections

Section 1:
    Records Audio, shows the sound wave, Decomposes it using fourier transform, shows the frequency spectra, reconstructs the audio using the inverse fourier trasnform, and shows its sound wave. 

Section 2:
    Takes a live audio feed,  applies the fourier trasnsform, and shows the frequency spectra in real time

Section 3:
    Takes a live audio feed, applies the fourier transform, and displays the decomposed sinus waves along with the original sound wave in real time.
